I discovered these spirits through symbols marked on runes I found as I crafted, built, and survived.\n\nTh' first spirit, that I came t' know as \"Da\", and depicted as {$DEITY:EVIL}, a symbol whose shape appears t' be a twisted and corrupted horned beast. They were th' restless nights, th' sprained ankle, and th' giant rats always nippin' at me heels.\n\nTh' second spirit, that I came t' know as \"Wry\", and depicted as {$DEITY:CHAOS}, a symbol representin' multiple branched paths leadin' t' nowhar and possibly everywhere. They were th' ambivalence o' nature itself, th' chaotic dance o' heated combat, or whether this berry was safe t' eat.\n\nTh' third and final spirit, that I came t' know as \"Aw\", and depicted as {$DEITY:GOOD}, a symbol that recollects feelings o' a soft hug, a safe aura, or a delicate rin' imbued with peace. They were th' good on this island, as little o' it as thar was.\n\nI learned I could control certain aspects o' th' island by invokin' these spirits through th' runes. Through some found texts, I eventually discovered that I could sacrifice these runes at an altar t' transform these runes into more pure and potent forms. Luckily, I was able t' fashion me own altar and luckily th' spirits accepted it as a place o' invocation.\n\nThese were not simple spirits after all; these were deities."],
			"nowhereToRun": ["Nowhar t' Run", "Despite our best efforts, our team remains ensnared by th' inexorable grasp o' these enigmatic islands. Each island we discover as we sail outwards be indeed a different island, a different shape, a different climate, but it \"feels\" th' same. Th' pull o' th' island be still thar. Th' journals we come across speak o' th' same manifestations o' old gods and livin' islands. Is th' island simply transmogrifyin' into these new shapes as we reach some unknown border between them? Is th' island part o' some cosmic die, rerollin' us as we sail th' treacherous seas?\n\n  That bein' said, we have noticed somethin' peculiar. As we chart out th' neighbourin' islands, we notice th' further we push out th' better th' plunder. Th' resources we gather from creatures have increased in quality. Th' booty we dig up be more plentiful.\n\n  Conversely, our proximity t' our island o' origin seems t' draw more kindred spirits t' our cause. Fellow survivors become fast friends, offerin' us invaluable trade and support in our ceaseless struggle t' come across our way back t' our homeland."]
